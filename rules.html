			<h1>Rules of Blackjack</h1>
			<h2>THE OBJECT</h2>
			<p>The object of the game of Blackjack is to obtain a total value of cards equal to or less than 21 that is
				higher than the dealer's card value.
				If the value of your cards exceeds 21, then you automatically lose.
				If your card value is less than or equal to 21, and the dealer's value exceeds 21, then you
				automatically win.
				If neither of the card values exceeds 21, then the higher value wins. In the case of ties (called a
				push), neither side in the casino game wins or loses.</p>
			<h2>THE PEOPLE</h2>
			<p>Although there are seven seats at the table, Blackjack is not a group game.
				The players do not normally play as a team against the dealer.
				For each player, it is as though there were no one else at the table.
				You may be a big winner while the person next to you has lost hundreds of dollars.</p>
			<h2>BASIC PLAY</h2>
			<p>After all the wagers are placed in the appropriate betting squares, the dealer then deals clockwise from
				first base to third base, one card at a time to each player.
				The cards are dealt face up and are placed in front of your bet.
				The dealer always has one card face up and one card face down.
				After each player has two cards, the dealer goes back to first base and continues clockwise around the
				table, giving additional cards to players as they desire (called hitting), until the players wish no
				more cards (called standing) or have exceeded the 21 count (called busting).
				After collecting the bets of all players who have busted, the dealer reveals his down card.
				He then hits or stands according to the casino rules and collects from or pays off the remaining players
				accordingly.
				Any first two cards consisting of an Ace and 10-count card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) form a natural or
				Blackjack.
				This is an automatic winner if the dealer doesn't have a natural also.
				While all other payoffs in Blackjack are paid at even money (one to one), a natural is paid a premium,
				three to two.
				A natural pays fifteen dollars on a ten-dollar wager, whereas a normal win pays only ten dollars on a
				ten-dollar wager.
				The dealer can also have a natural. The dealer is allowed to look at the down card whenever an Ace-card
				is showing (called peeking).
				If the two cards form a natural, the dealer automatically wins from any player not also having a
				natural.
				The player's natural is considered a push vs. a dealer natural and the wager is neither taken nor paid.
			</p>
			<h2>PLAYER OPTIONS</h2>
			<p>One of the delights of Blackjack is that the player has so many decisions to make.</p>
			<h3>STANDING</h3>
			<p>If you think your score is high enough to beat the dealer you can stand and you are getting no more
				cards.</p>
			<h3>HITTING</h3>
			<p>If you think you need another card to beat the dealer then you can hit.</p>
			<h3>DOUBLING DOWN</h3>
			<p>After you have looked at your first two cards, you may feel you have a good hand that will become a very
				good hand with one additional card.
				This is an ideal time for the double-down bet.
				The basic double-down play means that you may make a second wager equal to the amount of your
				original bet and receive one and only one additional card.</p>
			<h3>PAIR SPLITTING</h3>
			<p>When your first two cards have the same point value, you have the option of separating them and playing
				them as two separate hands (face cards and 10s are usually considered pairs, but you would almost never
				want to split a 20).
				You may draw as many cards as you wish to split pairs (except split Aces-see below).
				You must double your bet so that there is an equal amount wagered on each hand.
				A special case of pair splitting involves Aces. The casino allows you only one more card for each split
				Ace because it is such an advantageous card for the player.
				In addition, if you receive a 10 for a natural on one of the split Aces, it is paid off only as a
				21-value hand (one to one) instead of as a natural (three to two).</p>
			<h3>INSURANCE</h3>
			<p>When the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, play is stopped as the dealer asks, "Insurance, anyone?"
				Actually, the name "insurance" is misleading, because you are not insuring anything.
				You are making a side bet on whether or not the dealer has a 10-value card as his face-down card.
				The dealer must make the insurance offer before looking at his down card, so he has no idea what is
				there when he takes the insurance bets.
				You can make an insurance bet in an amount up to one half of your initial wager in the betting square.
				The insurance bet is placed in the large semicircle so labeled. As the semicircle states, insurance pays
				off two to one.
				For example, if you originally bet ten dollars, and the dealer hand showed an Ace up, you could bet up
				to five dollars in the insurance semicircle.
				If the dealer's card turned out to be a 10, you would lose your original ten-dollar bet, but your
				insurance bet of five dollars would win the ten dollars back.
				If the dealer does not have a 10 as the face-down card, you lose your five dollars and play on; the hand
				continues in the normal fashion.</p>
